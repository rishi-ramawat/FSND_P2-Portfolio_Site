# Build a Portfolio Site

**Note:** This is a solution to project 2 of the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program][1] based on the course [Intro to HTML and CSS (ud304)][2].

### How to run the application

Download the files and open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.

### Features

+ Clean and simple design
+ Fully Responsive
+ Works on `mobile`, `tablet`, and `desktop` browsers.
+ Works on **IE8** or less too even though `HTML5` & `CSS3` is used to build the project.

### Project Submission

You will be provided with a design mockup as a [PDF-file][3] and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of your Nanodegree program.

The design mockup is located [here][3].
